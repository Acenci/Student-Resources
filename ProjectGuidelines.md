# Front End Web Development
### Requirements:
* Must use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and/or jQuery

* Must be responsive to different device sizes

* Must implement an API.  There are TONS of APIs on almost any subject.  You learn how to do this in AJAX.  
    * [Enormous list of public APIs](https://www.publicapis.com/)
    * API should do something with user input or some user interaction, and return info based on that request.
    
* Must implement a JavaScript Framework (not just Bootstrap)
    * [AngularJS from Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/angular-basics)
    * [Ember.js from Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/emberjs) 
    * [Need help deciding on a framework?  Todomvc.com](http://todomvc.com/). There are many JavaScript frameworks to choose from, and you have your choice of either AngularJS or Ember.js in Treehouse.
    * You may also self-study a JavaScript framework that is external to Treehouse, if you don't prefer Angular or Ember.  Leave an artifact proving you learned a JS framework in your Asana task, so we can verify its completion.
    
* Must have code on GitHub in a repository no later than Friday, March 25, 2016 at noon!  Remember, no extensions!
    * You can host your front end project on GitHub using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) if you'd like!  (optional, but recommended)
    
* Have fun!  Your project should be something you're proud of, and that adequately demonstrates your base knowledge in the concepts you've learned.

### What NOT To Do:
* Do not submit any recognizeable version of your original "How to Make a Website" website!

* Do not submit a project that is clearly plain, vanilla Bootstrap!

# Server-side languages/frameworks: PHP, Rails, or .NET Development
### Requirements:

* Must be responsive to different device sizes

* Must have code on GitHub in a repository no later than Friday, March 25, 2016 at noon!  Remember, no extensions!

* Have fun!  Your project should be something you're proud of, and that adequately demonstrates your base knowledge in the concepts you've learned.

# Mobile Platforms: Android or iOS Development
### Requirements:
* Must implement your core language (Java or Swift), and either use a back end as a service or an API.

* Must be built for more than one screen/device size

* Must have code on GitHub in a repository no later than Friday, March 25, 2016 at noon!  Remember, no extensions!

* Have fun!  Your project should be something you're proud of, and that adequately demonstrates your base knowledge in the concepts you've learned.
