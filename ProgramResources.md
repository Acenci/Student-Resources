### FAQs:
* What if I fall behind?
    * It happens!  We will reach out to you if we notice you've fallen behind, but please reach out to [Robin](mailto:robin@codelouisville.org) if there's anything actionable we can do to help you get caught up!  Falling more than 2 weeks behind makes it very difficult to catch up.

* What if I need to restart?
    * If you're a front end web development student who needs to restart, you can do so only one time.  This rule went into effect during the July 2015 cohort, so if you've already restarted once since then, there can be no additional restarts.  We cap enrollment and want to give everybody a fair shot at joining the program.
    * If you're a server-side or mobile development student who needs to restart **and you're a previous graduate of the program**, you may restart with us as long as the program exists.
    * If you're a server-side or mobile development student who needs to restart **and you're NOT a previous graduate of the program**, you can do so only one time.

* What if I need to miss a meetup?
    * We understand!  We require you to miss no more than three (3) meetups per cohort.  If you miss more than three meetups, we recommend your restart at a more convenient time.

* What if I can't attend on my scheduled night, but I don't want to be absent that week?
    * You may attend another meetup (front end web development and .NET only) during the week, as your schedule allows and as meetups are available.

* What if I have to be late to a meetup or leave early from a meetup?
    * As long as you stay an hour per night (at least), either scenario is fine.  Please remember to sign in and out.
